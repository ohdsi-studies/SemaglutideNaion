	abstract = {Objective
Concerns exist about semaglutide, potentially worsening sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR) in individuals with diabetes. This study aimed to explore the association between semaglutide and the risk of DR progression over three years in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is hypothesized that any observed deterioration in DR among T2D patients following semaglutide use would be temporary and unrelated to long-term progression.
Methods
Retrospective data analysis identified 4086 patients with T2D and DR by ICD-10 codes in a Retina only practice from January to June 2020. Use of semaglutide was found in 116 patients. Inclusion criteria included at least 1 year of semaglutide use and documentation of level of non-proliferative (NPDR) and proliferative (PDR) retinopathy, visual acuity (VA) and Central Subfield Thickness (CST).
Results
87 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, ranging in age from 38 to 84 years (mean age of 62.4 years), and having an average duration of semaglutide usage of approximately 2.9 years. Gender distribution included 58.6 \% male and 41.4 \% female patients, with 83.9 \% Caucasian, 11.5 \% Black, and 10.3 \% Hispanic backgrounds. The baseline HbA1c level averaged 7.6 \%, ranging from 5.9 \% to 10.9 \%, with a standard deviation of 1.1. The last self-reported HbA1c level averaged 7.4 \%, ranging from 5.2 \% to 14 \%, with a standard deviation of 1.5. Baseline DR severity correlated with progression risk: 2.7 \% for DRSS level ≤ 43, 28 \% for levels 47/53, and 45 \% for baseline PDR. Patients required an average of 12.6 intravitreal injections. Visual acuity remained stable for 72.4 \% of patients, with 16.1 \% experiencing a loss and 11.5 \% achieving improvement.
Conclusion
Semaglutide use was not associated with increased risk of progression of DR, visual loss, or an increased number of intravitreal injections over a 3-year period of time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Propensity score adjustment is a popular approach for confounding control in observational studies. Reliable frameworks are needed to determine relative propensity score performance in large-scale studies, and to establish optimal propensity score model selection methods.
METHODS: We detail a propensity score evaluation framework that includes synthetic and real-world data experiments. Our synthetic experimental design extends the 'plasmode' framework and simulates survival data under known effect sizes, and our real-world experiments use a set of negative control outcomes with presumed null effect sizes. In reproductions of two published cohort studies, we compare two propensity score estimation methods that contrast in their model selection approach: L1-regularized regression that conducts a penalized likelihood regression, and the 'high-dimensional propensity score' (hdPS) that employs a univariate covariate screen. We evaluate methods on a range of outcome-dependent and outcome-independent metrics.
RESULTS: L1-regularization propensity score methods achieve superior model fit, covariate balance and negative control bias reduction compared with the hdPS. Simulation results are mixed and fluctuate with simulation parameters, revealing a limitation of simulation under the proportional hazards framework. Including regularization with the hdPS reduces commonly reported non-convergence issues but has little effect on propensity score performance.
CONCLUSIONS: L1-regularization incorporates all covariates simultaneously into the propensity score model and offers propensity score performance superior to the hdPS marginal screen.},

	abstract = {Glucagon-like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a group of relatively novel medications for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. These medications can mimic the naturally occurring incretins of the body, which promote the release of insulin in response to hyperglycaemia. The anti-glycaemic effects of these medications can be profound and carry other metabolic benefits such as promoting weight loss. Clinical trials have shown GLP-1 RAs are safe to use from a cardiovascular perspective. However, some trials have suggested a link between GLP-1 RA use and worsening diabetic retinopathy. The conclusions surrounding this link are poorly established as data is drawn primarily from cardiovascular outcome trials. If an association does exist, a possible explanation might be the observed phenomenon of early worsening diabetic retinopathy with rapid correction of hyperglycaemic states. Trials which look at diabetic retinopathy as a primary outcome in relation to use of GLP-1 RAs are sparse and warrant investigation given the growing use of this group of medications. Therefore currently, it is uncertain what effect, beneficial or adverse, GLP-1 RA use has on diabetic retinopathy. This article provides an overview of GLP-1 RA use as a treatment for diabetes mellitus and the current understanding of their relationship with diabetic retinopathy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate systematically the natural history of visual outcome in nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).
DESIGN: Cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred forty consecutive untreated patients (386 eyes) with NAION, first seen in our clinic from 1973 to 2000.
METHODS: At first visit, all patients gave a detailed ophthalmic and medical history and underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation. Visual evaluation was done by recording visual acuity, using the Snellen visual acuity chart, and visual fields with a Goldmann perimeter. The same ophthalmic evaluation was performed at each follow-up visit.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Natural history of visual acuity and visual field outcome in NAION.
RESULTS: Of the 386 eyes, 332 had 8 weeks or more of follow-up from the initial visit. At the initial visit, in eyes seen {\textless} or =2 weeks from onset of symptoms, 49\% had visual acuity of {\textgreater} or =20/30 and 23\% had {\textless} or =20/200; in these eyes, 38\% had minimal to mild visual field defect and 43\% marked to severe defect. In those who were first seen {\textless} or =2 weeks after onset with visual acuity {\textless} or =20/70, there was improvement in 41\% at 6 months and in 42\% at 1 year after the initial visit. Two years after the initial visit, there was deterioration in 9\% of eyes with initial visual acuity of {\textgreater} or =20/60, and in 18\% of those with initial visual acuity of {\textless} or =20/70. In those who were first seen {\textless} or =2 weeks of onset with moderate to severe visual field defect, there was improvement in 26\% at 6 months and 27\% at 1 year after the initial visit. Two years after the initial visit, 27\% of eyes with initial minimal to mild field defects showed worsening, as did 19\% of those with moderate to severe defects.
CONCLUSIONS: About half of the eyes with NAION presented with almost normal visual acuity (20/15 to 20/30) at the initial visit. Thus, the presence of normal visual acuity does not rule out NAION. Visual acuity and visual fields showed improvement or further deterioration mainly up to 6 months, with no significant change after that.},

	abstract = {Objective This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating phenotype algorithms (PAs) using the open-source tool, Cohort Diagnostics.
Materials and Methods The method is based on several diagnostic criteria to evaluate a patient cohort returned by a PA. Diagnostics include estimates of incidence rate, index date entry code breakdown, and prevalence of all observed clinical events prior to, on, and after index date. We test our framework by evaluating one PA for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and two PAs for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) across 10 different observational data sources.
Results By utilizing CohortDiagnostics, we found that the population-level characteristics of individuals in the cohort of SLE closely matched the disease’s anticipated clinical profile. Specifically, the incidence rate of SLE was consistently higher in occurrence among females. Moreover, expected clinical events like laboratory tests, treatments, and repeated diagnoses were also observed. For AD, although one PA identified considerably fewer patients, absence of notable differences in clinical characteristics between the two cohorts suggested similar specificity.
Discussion We provide a practical and data-driven approach to evaluate PAs, using two clinical diseases as examples, across a network of OMOP data sources. Cohort Diagnostics can ensure the subjects identified by a specific PA align with those intended for inclusion in a research study.
Conclusion Diagnostics based on large-scale population-level characterization can offer insights into the misclassification errors of PAs.},
